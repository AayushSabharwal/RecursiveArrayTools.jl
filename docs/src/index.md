# RecursiveArrayTools.jl: Arrays of Arrays and Even Deeper

RecursiveArrayTools.jl is a set of tools for dealing with recursive arrays like
arrays of arrays. It contains type wrappers for making recursive arrays act more
like normal arrays (for example, automating the recursion of broadcast, maps,
iteration, and more), and utility functions which make it easier to work with
recursive arrays.

## Installation

To install RecursiveArrayTools.jl, use the Julia package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("RecursiveArrayTools")
```
